# Privacy policy 👻

Crocuda only collects the minimum personal data needed for services to run.
The less you give, the less is exposed.

## The documentation website.

The website is exposed through a simple webproxy that automaticaly logs `your ip` and `page requests`.

No data harvesting.

The browser **cookies**, as well as **session/local storages** are not used at all.
And **javascript** is only used to animate some components.

No tracking, No profiling here.

## The terminal user interface(TUI).

The terminal user interface needs to store your `ssh public key` to authenticate you.
And that is the only data it realy needs.

But the law enforces the collection and persistence for 12 months of:

- **Your last connection ip**,
  You would want to use a VPN or a mixnet to access the services more privately.

- A firstname, lastname, e-mail and phone number.
  That is why you need to send them as environment variables upon connection.

None of this data is analysed or sent to third parties.

## Chat sessions.

When you need help for the services chat sessions can be initiated.
And **you** choose the time persistence of our messages thanks to private messaging functionalities.

## Payments.

Bookkeeping monero incoming addresses wouldn't make sense
as they are one shot untraceable addresses.

But a **payment history** is kept to troubleshoot any issue.

## Extreme cases.

We do not disclose your personal data to any third parties
with exception to when needed by the law.
